## üïµÔ∏è PicoCTF: *n0s4n1ty 1* ‚Äî Web Exploitation-CTF-Writeup

#### üîπ **Step 1:**  
Click on the link labeled **"here"** to open the target website. You‚Äôll land on a web page where you‚Äôre prompted to upload a file/profile.

#### üîπ **Step 2:**  
Create a simple `.txt` file and insert a **malicious payload** into it. You can use **ChatGPT** to generate this payload ‚Äî just ask it for a PHP web shell or a suitable payload for solving this PicoCTF challenge.

#### üîπ **Step 3:**  
Once you receive the payload, paste it into your `.txt` file and **save it as** `shell.php`.

#### üîπ **Step 4:**  
Now go back to the website. Click on **"Choose File"**, select the `shell.php` file you just created, and then click on **"Upload File"**.

#### üîπ **Step 5:**  
After uploading, you‚Äôll be given a **file path**. Copy this path and paste it into the URL bar of your browser, like so:

```
uploads/shell.php?cmd=whoami
```

Make sure to append this after the base URL (don't forget to include any numeric ID or directory structure if present).

---

#### üîπ **Step 6:**  
If everything worked, you‚Äôll see the result of the `whoami` command, which confirms the shell is active. You can now execute additional commands by modifying the `cmd` parameter.

To directly retrieve the flag, run:

```
uploads/shell.php?cmd=sudo%20cat%20/root/flag.txt
```

Note: Use `%20` in place of spaces in the URL.

---

#### üîπ **Step 7:**  
üéâ **Congratulations!** You‚Äôll see the flag displayed on the screen. Copy it, paste it into the PicoCTF flag submission box, and click **"Submit Flag"** to complete the challenge.
